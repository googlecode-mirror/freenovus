# Free facts, fast. #
freeNOVUS aims to make news readable again.  We seek to replace the long and over-detailed article format of mainstream media with short synopses and summaries that get to the point.  This is to be accomplished through a wiki-like system that builds "articlets" which are released.
## Articlets might contain: ##
  * Crucial facts pertaining to a situation.
  * Constant updates.
  * Quotes from people on scene.
  * Links to relevant videos, speeches, or websites.
  * Quick background info links for those who need to be filled in.

Articlets will always remain strictly neutral-which will be enforced by the wiki-like system.  Through freeNOVUS, people can cut down on the time it takes reading about current events while still being very-well informed.  This would allow people to become more aware of more topics in a fast-paced world, in addition to freeing up reading time for critical thought.

The freenovus application is written in PHP (for now) and is OSS.
